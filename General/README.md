The functions demonstrated are as follows.
- Red mask
- Green mask
- Blue mask
- Gray scale
- Gaussian Blur
- Canny Edge Detection

## Running
To run simply type the following into terminal on a machine running python 2.7 with OpenCV installed.
```
run python general.py
```
Now simply type the name of the file you want to perform the functions on for example.
